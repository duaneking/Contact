# Contact
I can't contact anybody on GitHub directly due to the lack of a chat or direct message feature unless a PR is involved, so if I want to reach out to soembody but not file a bug agaisnt a project they have, I have no way to do that.

I think that is broken.

So here is how to contact me directly, just file a bug here.  It's ok. This project exists explictly to be a point of contact if nothing else - like my twitter @honestduane or my keybase @dfk - works.
